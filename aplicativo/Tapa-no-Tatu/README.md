# Tapa no Tatu

**Tapa no Tatu** is an hardware project for the **mole game**, but whith armadillos!

This repository contains the aplication that works as a remote interface to the phisical circuit. The project uses [paho-mqtt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/paho-mqtt), a [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) lib for Python an js, to communicate along the devices. The hardware declaration and python script can be found [here](https://github.com/DamaralHenrique/LabDig_I/tree/feature/TapaNoTatu).

The app uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) and was developed using [Expo](https://expo.dev/) website. You can find the Expo Snack [here](https://snack.expo.dev/@henrquehdm/tapa-no-tatu). You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators.
